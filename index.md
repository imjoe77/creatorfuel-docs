## Introduction
CreatorFuel is a full-stack SaaS (Software as a Service) web application that allows creators to receive tips and payments directly from their supporters.

The platform works as a fundraiser / tipping service where creators can create their profile, configure payment settings, and receive payments from fans without any platform charges.

CreatorFuel follows a multi-user SaaS model where each creator can sign up, manage their dashboard, configure Razorpay keys, and use the platform to receive payments securely.

This project was built using Next.js, MongoDB, Razorpay API, Tailwind CSS, and NextAuth.

---

## Problem Statement
Many small creators do not have an easy way to accept payments without building their own payment system.

Existing platforms often charge fees or require complex setup.

CreatorFuel solves this by providing a simple SaaS platform where creators can sign up, configure their payment details, and receive tips directly from fans without hidden charges from the platform.
